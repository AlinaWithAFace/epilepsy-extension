The generator will generate a number of flashing videos, there's a few parameters we can play with easily here

`pattern` is either solid, horizontal stripes, or vertical stripes
`colors` is the pool of colors we'll randomize between

We pick a duration between `min_length` and `max_length`

`number of videos` is the number of videos we'll generate in a given run

The file naming scheme for the videos is `pattern-color1-color2-length`
