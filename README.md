Potential Triggers

* Television screens or computer monitors due to the flicker or rolling images.
* Certain video games or TV broadcasts containing rapid flashes or alternating patterns of different colors.
* Intense strobe lights like visual fire alarms.
* Natural light, such as sunlight, especially when shimmering off water, flickering through trees or through the slats of Venetian blinds.
* Certain visual patterns, especially stripes of contrasting colors.
* Some people wonder whether flashing lights on the top of buses or emergency vehicles may trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy too.

1. More than three flashes within any 1-s period.
2. From the minimal expected viewing distance, the
total area of concurrent flashes subtends at the eye
a solid angle of >0.006 steradians. This solid angle
equates to one fourth of the area of the central 10
degrees of the visual field. For practical purposes,
the area can be taken as applying to an area >25%
of the area of a television screen, assuming standard
viewing distances of ≥2m(∼9 feet).

Risk factors for screens:

* the brightness of the flashing
* the contrast with background lighting
* the distance between the viewer and the light source
* the wavelength of the light
* whether a person’s eyes are open or closed at the time

> Results: A flash is a potential hazard if it has luminance ≥20
> cd/m2, occurs at a frequency of ≥3 Hz, and occupies a solid visual angle of ≥0.006 steradians (∼10% of the central visual field
> or 25% of screen area at typical viewing distances). A transition
> to or from saturated red also is considered a risk. A pattern with

> distance a solid angle of >0.006 steradians, the luminance of the
> lightest stripe is >50 cd/m2, and the pattern is presented for ≥0.5
> s, then the pattern should display no more than five light–dark
> pairs of stripes, if the stripes change direction, oscillate, flash,
> or reverse in contrast; if the pattern is unchanging or smoothly
> drifting in one direction, no more than eight stripes. These principles are easier to apply in the case of fixed media, for example,

Notes/Ideas
---

* Possibly after processing any video add some sort of filter for the relevant portions of the video so it's still watchable?
  * eg a black-white filter that maybe brings most of the colors to grey to lower any contrast? 
* Collect user-tagged triggers for videos, eg timestamp 1 - timestamp 2 is a likely trigger
  * Add to database for further model training
* For user testing, ask people on the epilepsy subreddit?
  * Eg here's a thread with a few people claiming photosensetivity https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/l5o436/tiktok_just_added_this_popup_i_know_its_not_many/
