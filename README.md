Potential Triggers

* Television screens or computer monitors due to the flicker or rolling images.
* Certain video games or TV broadcasts containing rapid flashes or alternating patterns of different colors.
* Intense strobe lights like visual fire alarms.
* Natural light, such as sunlight, especially when shimmering off water, flickering through trees or through the slats of Venetian blinds.
* Certain visual patterns, especially stripes of contrasting colors.
* Some people wonder whether flashing lights on the top of buses or emergency vehicles may trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy too.

1. More than three flashes within any 1-s period.
2. From the minimal expected viewing distance, the
total area of concurrent flashes subtends at the eye
a solid angle of >0.006 steradians. This solid angle
equates to one fourth of the area of the central 10
degrees of the visual field. For practical purposes,
the area can be taken as applying to an area >25%
of the area of a television screen, assuming standard
viewing distances of ≥2m(∼9 feet).

Risk factors for screens:

* the brightness of the flashing
* the contrast with background lighting
* the distance between the viewer and the light source
* the wavelength of the light
* whether a person’s eyes are open or closed at the time
