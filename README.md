Potential Triggers

* Television screens or computer monitors due to the flicker or rolling images.
* Certain video games or TV broadcasts containing rapid flashes or alternating patterns of different colors.
* Intense strobe lights like visual fire alarms.
* Natural light, such as sunlight, especially when shimmering off water, flickering through trees or through the slats of Venetian blinds.
* Certain visual patterns, especially stripes of contrasting colors.
* Some people wonder whether flashing lights on the top of buses or emergency vehicles may trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy too.
